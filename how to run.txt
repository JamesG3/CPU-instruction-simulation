Upload MIPS.cpp, imem.txt, dmem.txt and Makefile.txt to gauss, make sure they are under same folder.

Use instructions below to compile and run the code.

g++ MIPS.cpp
./a.out

Then RFresult.txt and dmemresult.txt are generated in the same folder.

vi RFresult.txt
vi dmemresult.txt

To check the output file.

Delete these two files every time before re-run the code.
